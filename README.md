Hello, I am Afsara, introducing EmitLess, an app enhancing travel with a focus on sustainability. Our market research found a need for personalized travel and interest in carbon offsetting. EmitLess offers a unique solution allowing travelers to fund environmental projects, personalizing their journey and reducing their carbon footprint. Users can showcase their impact via EcoShare on social media. This personalization gives Cathay Pacific a competitive edge, aligning with its carbon neutrality goals and providing travelers a meaningful way to contribute to sustainability.
